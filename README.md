# TimetableTracker

This program is used to track and display course enrollments for all of UofT's A&S courses for the Fall-Winter 2022-2023 session.

## Usage
run `runoptions_independent.py` on your computer if you want to use a GUI to use this.

## How to open Python files

The most straightforward way is to open this entire project with an IDE such as Pycharm. Otherwise, as long as you have Python installed, use command prompt to run them (`py runoptions_independent.py`) given the working directory is the directory the `py` folder is in (type `cmd` in the file search thing).

**This tool cannot capture enrollments over time - I'll update this repository throughout this year, so you must pull from it**

## Dependencies

Use `pip` to install them. For instance, run `pip install <dependency>` for each dependency below after you have installed python.

```
matplotlib
pyplot
```
